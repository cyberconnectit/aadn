    <h1>"Where children's smiles are made"</h1>
    <p>
Welcome to Amy’s Angels Day Nursery. A nursery like no other because here at Amy’s Angels Day Nursery we focus on your child’s development 
and their happiness which is one of our main priorities because a happy child is a child willing to learn as well as engage with peers. 
The setting has exceptional qualified staff members who create a welcoming and nurturing environment for each and every child of all 
abilities everyday with weekly planning, observations and tracking you can rest assured knowing that your child is developing at a steady 
pace and learning sufficiently age appropriate everyday.
    </p>
<p>
We focus on all areas of learning but as well as this we believe it is important for children to have a range of experiences to learn from which is why at Amy’s Angels Day Nursery we hire professionals to come into the nursery every week for the children to learn and develop interest extending from toys and technology, for example our amazing facilities such as our sensory room and soft play building are where the children are able to take risks and learn from them in a safe and well managed environment. We also have classes and days such as Baby gym, Just dance Mondays, football Thursdays and musical Fridays which is where all children exceed and are able to express themselves allowing to see the biggest smiles on there faces at home time, which you can agree is one of the most rewarding things to see as a parents/career.
</p>
<p>
These are just a few examples of why Amy’s Angels Day Nursery is perfect for your little ones. Feeling intrigued? Why don’t you give us a call using the contact information and come and see the wonderful smiles on the children’s faces for yourself and the manager/ owner of the nursery will be more than happy to meet with you with a time of your choice and show you around our nursery.
